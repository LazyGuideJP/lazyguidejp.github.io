# Setup Introduction

If you're setting up afresh, please follow the guide from top to bottom as some of the steps need to be in chronological order.

This guide is a Hybrid Setup of [Rudnam's Anki Note/Yomitan CSS](https://github.com/rudnam/JP-study), my Anki Add-ons, yomitan and other tools

If you are looking to migrate your old JPMN setup to the new Lazy Setup, please follow this [guide](transferJPMNToLazy.md)
