# About

I made the lazy guide because:

- Back then I just wanted a straightforward all-in-one source for all the latest tech towards setting up JP tools, everything was scattered and was full of few pages of explanation that I didn't want to read, so I took the matters into my own hands and I've been maintaining the Lazy Guide for a few years now

- My goal is to update whenever there are newer tools around and I'll write it at the clearest/most concise possible

[Old Lazy Guide](https://rentry.co/lazyGuide/) | [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/u/LazyGuideJP)

If no one can `reach me` for a long time(6 months+) consider it abandoned, anyone can continue my guide from here: [Repository](https://github.com/LazyGuideJP/LazyGuideJP.github.io) | [License](https://github.com/LazyGuideJP/LazyGuideJP.github.io/blob/main/LICENSE)

- No plans to abandon right now, this is an in-case matter
