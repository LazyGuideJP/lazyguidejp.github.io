## Extra Info and Tips

#### Info 1: Anime Mining Demo

??? info "Anime Mining Demo <small>(click here)</small>"

    - Outdated; you use asbplayer's hotkey(`Ctrl + Shift + U`) instead of `ShareX` hotkeys to automatically get both `screenshot` and `audio`

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MAiNi_ME6zw" title="Mining Demo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Tip 1: Synchronizing Subtitle

??? tip "Synchronizing Subtitle <small>(click here)</small>"

    Depending on the source of your `Anime`, the `Subtitle` could be out of sync, to remedy that problem:

    - +100ms - `CTRL + SHIFT + LEFT ARROW KEY`

    - -100ms - `CTRL + SHIFT + RIGHT ARROW KEY`

#### Tip 2: Skip Audio Recording when Mining

??? tip "Skip Audio Recording when Mining <small>(click here)</small>"

    - You can skip the audio recording when mining as it is time consuming

    - If you also manage to do your Anki Cards below 5s each, you will barely hear the recorded Audio

## FAQs

#### Question 1: Why Enable Experimental Web Platform features?

??? question "Why Enable Experimental Web Platform features? <small>(click here)</small>"

    - Some `Anime` have multiple `audio sources` such as `en` and `jp`, by enabling this we can pick `jp` source if it's not the default

#### Question 2: Why Ignore Request Permission to Anki?

??? question "Why Ignore Request Permission to Anki? <small>(click here)</small>"

    - Because we are using the normal method where we can use the full features of `Anki` and `Yomitan` setup

#### Question 3: Why not install the Chrome Extension?

??? question "Why not install the Chrome Extension? <small>(click here)</small>"

    - Same as `Question 2`, `asbplayer` has a built-in `Anki` support that lacks the feature of our own `Anki` and `Yomitan` support
