# Want to contribute?

### Criteria

- Do you feel that the thing you want to add isn't just another `redundancy` or `noise`?

- Can you make it the laziest/fastest way possible?
    - Provide laymann's term (when needed)
    - Make the information most concise, exclude jargons and technical terms (if not needed)
    - Screenshot of instruction with detailed `box` and `arrows`
    - The tool is stable enough and will last forever (if you don't update it)

#### How to submit the contribution?

You can either submit a [Github: Pull Request](https://github.com/LazyGuideJP/LazyGuideJP.github.io/pulls) with the guide already organized in a notepad and screenshots edited

- You can `ask me first` if I'd actually want it on the guide so your effort is not wasted

### Ideas

Here is a list of ideas I still had no time to work on OR no device to test it on:

1. An actual script to install all the setup from top to bottom so users don't actually have to do a lot of manual stuff from this guide

2. Linux Setup

3. Kindle Setup

4. Agent Setup
