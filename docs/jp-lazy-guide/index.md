Lazy Guide is based on a **plug-and-play** philosophy, designed forâ€”

- People who don't want to bother customizing their settings or knowing stuff technically
- For people who want an all-in-one import and everything and done compared to other fully detailed guides but scattered tools
- You want stable tools that last forever (If you don't update nothing will break)
