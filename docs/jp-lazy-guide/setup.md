# Setup Introduction

If you are a fresh setup, please follow the guide from top to bottom as some of the guides are needed to be in chronological order.

This guide is a Hybrid Setup of [Lapis](https://github.com/donkuri/lapis), my Anki Add-ons, yomitan and my tools settings

If you are coming from [JPMN Format](setupAnkiOld.md), see [Transfer: JPMN to Lapis](transferJPMNToLapis.md)
