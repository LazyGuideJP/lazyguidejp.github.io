??? note "What's the purpose of JP Lazy Guide? <small>(click here)</small>"

    - People who don't want to bother customizing their settings or knowing stuff technically
    - For people who want an all-in-one import and everything and done compared to other fully detailed guides but scattered tools
    - You want stable tools that lasts forever (If you don't update nothing will break)

    Do you want a very detailed guide instead of being spoonfed? Go to [Donkuri's Guide](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/)
